# ConcertCityMapper

This script is a small personal project to have an understanding of in which citoes my favourite bands tour the most. It first retrive my favorite bands from Spotify APIs then retrive 
informations about past concerts from Setlist.fm APIs and count the occurrency. Later, after filtering by area (a list of European countries of interest in my case), plot a bar chart with the cities
in order of the number of overall concert. Now, I can finally decide where to move! :)
